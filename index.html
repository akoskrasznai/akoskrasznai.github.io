        <p id="bio">I am living in a small house with my wife and three children along the Eastern shore of Canada. I do not have to go to work since Friday, 13th of March 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions; however, we are lucky as I still receive my salary twice a month. Consequently I have tremendous amount of free time and decided to learn something new. Here comes <strong>CODING</strong> So far I have done the following:</p>
        <ul>
          </a>
          <li>Enrolled at a 'Stay at Home' prep code camp w <a class="greenfox" href="http://stayathome.greenfox.academy/april-20/">GreenFox Academy</a></li>
              <li>Started learning Python with the help of <a class="al" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring stuff with python by Al Sweigart</a></li>
         <li>Registered with <a class="freecc" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a></li>
          <li>Enrolled <a class="cs50" href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50</a> at Harvard</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>freeCodeCamp.org</h4>

        <h4>Automate the boring stuff with Python</h4>
          <p>Chapter 6, installed two IDEs, able to do very basic stuff.</p>
